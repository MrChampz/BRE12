## Synopsis

This engine is the result of an intent to learn DirectX 12 and apply my knowledge about computer graphics. It is intended for learning purposes only, I do not plan to make a game or a commercial engine. 


## Examples

In the Visual Studio solution, there is a project called ExampleScenes where you can see a lot of different techniques (color mapping, normal mapping, height mapping, cube mapping, etc)

## Blog

I write a blog where I explain its design, and how I applied/learned the techniques I use.
